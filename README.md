## Why Letup?
We've all done it, you work for to long staring at the code for too long and there it is, the headache or eyestrain. 

Letup aims to solve this problem quite easily by giving you simple desktop notifications every 40-45 minutes of active usage to take very small breaks (1-5 minutes) with interesting tasks to do in the meanwhile. 

When you've actively stopped using the computer for the duration specified it will give you a badge for the task you have completed.
